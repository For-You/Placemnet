        Mr Jack's Set Trial

Mr. Jack is trying to create a Set to store strings. However, he’s not really sure if he has got it right. He wants you to tell him if he’s doing it correctly.

This is the arrangement: he will take all the strings from his set and give them to you in a String array. Accordingly, you have to say true if the strings form a Set and false if they don’t.

Write a static method Met that accepts as parameter a 1D String array and returns true or false as per the above condition.

Dr. CooCoo has a simple task for you. You are given a TreeMap with 3 keys: one, two and three. Keys are of String type and each has a String value.

Mr. Zaza is furnishing his house. He has the following requirement: his table and chair should be of same color, wardrobe and bed should be of same color and window and curtain should be of same color. <br>

Write a static method Met that accepts as TreeMap of String keys and String values. The keys are the furniture, and the values are the color. <br>

You have to return a modified TreeMap such that,

    if the original map has a table, then you new map should have a chair of same color <br>

        Summing Strings Into A Map	 <br>

We are going to sum up a string array into a LinkedHashMap of string keys and string values. <br>

This is how it is done: the keys are the first alphabets of each string. And the values are the sum of all the strings starting with that alphabet, in the order that they appear in the array. <br>

Write a method Met that accepts as parameter a string array and returns a LinkedHashMap. <br>

        Athlete Map

An athlete wants to calculate the how many times she has had similar statistics. 

In each run, she stores the following information: <br>

    name of the ground (String) <br>
    time taken in seconds (integer) <br>
    any injuries? (boolean) <br>

You have to write 2 classes: Run and FrequencyCalculator. <br>

In the Run class, you should have the variables for ground, time and injury and also a parameterized constructor in the same order. <br>

In the FrequencyCalculator, you should have a method insert that accepts as parameter a Run object. It should also have a method print, that prints all the runs and the number of times each has occurred for the athlete. A run is said to be identical if all the variables are exactly same. <br>

You have to print in increasing order of time taken. If time is same, then print in alphabetical order of ground. <br>

Write only the Run and FrequencyCalculator classes. The Main class has already been written. <br>
 <br>
Example Input: <br>

mud 500 false <br>
cement 1000 true <br>
forest 750 false <br>
unspecified 200 true <br>
mud 200 true <br>
mud 200 true <br>
treadmill 1000 false <br>

treadmill 1000 false <br>

unspecified, 200, true : 1 <br>
mud, 500, false : 1 <br>

}  <br>

Write a class called Solution. It has 4 methods:  <br>

    insert - accepts as parameter a Student object and stores it.  <br>
    printByAge - prints all the students in decreasing order of age  <br>
    printByFName - prints all the students in alphabetical order of first name  <br>
    printByLName - prints all the students in reverse alphabetical order of last name  <br>

Only write the Solution class. All other classes have been written.  <br>
